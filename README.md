# Ostin Kernel

Ostin project is based on (and is developed in loose coordination with) KolibriOS. It offers strict code formatting and commenting guidelines as well as proper documentation. While Kolibri is mostly developed by Russian/ex-USSR community, Ostin tries to be as much international as possible.

Ostin is also strictly assembly-only, just-for-fun operating system.
